### Hi, I'm MÃ¥ns.

I spend a lot of time thinking.

Most of the time I like to think about problems, and solution to problems. How a new technical gadget with the right use can help person x, or how a new service might affect group y. How some piece of javascript code can produce a certain result, or even how one persons' skill might be best utilized within a team. 

What drives my thinking is my never ending curiosity for the world around me, which has also become my biggest strength. It nurtures my creativity, gets me out to shoot photographs, and makes me look forward to a new day every day. My curiosity has also made me the generalist that I am. My wide range of interests and skills it in some ways what defines me as a person who excels at pieceing together ideas and concepts from different areas to create new and innovative ideas and solutions.
