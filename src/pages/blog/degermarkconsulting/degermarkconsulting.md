This project started in the beginning of the summer 2018. My aunt recently started a consultancy firm specialized in leadership and digitalization. The project involved designing and building the website from scratch. When I started, all I had to go on in terms of visual identity was a logotype and some images that she had provided. Combined with some typical characteristics of hers, that laid the foundation for the design of the website. 

I built the site using Gatsby.js(länk) and Netlify. The reason for this combination is mostly that Gatsby is a tool which I am quite proficient in using, combined with the fact that Netlify is a headless CMS that works seamlessly with Gatsby.js. The reason for using a CMS is that my aunt is not a developer yet still needs to be able to write blog posts, change texts on her website and so on, preferably completely without my help.

Selection of things I did and learned during this project:
* Designed a book cover for my aunt’s book 
* Configuring Netlify
* Designed the visual identity of the whole website
