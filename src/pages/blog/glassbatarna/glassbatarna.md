Fresh coast Is the result of a project me and 4 classmates did for a company with the same name during the spring of 2017 for the course Design Build test at Ume√• University. The final result was an app built with react native that we released on both Android and iOS.
My main responsibilities was UX design and some front end development. 

Feel free to contact me to hear more about this project
