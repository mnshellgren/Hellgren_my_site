Together with three classmates, we built a prototype of “smart shopping assistant” during a course in prototyping for mobile devices. I’ll let the following text introduce the prototype:

> We have identified a few problems associated with shopping. One is CO² emissions. Every day, huge amounts of co2 is released as a result of shipping goods across the globe. Another problem is the lack of information about those emissions. By presenting the environmental impact of shopping items in a clear and more simple way, we could increase consciousness. 

> We have also identified the problem of decision making, which is also what our concept centers around. Decision making is not only a matter of style and whether you like an item or not, but also a matter of cost and also a matter of being eco-friendly.
Our concept is a kind of “smart” assistant that enables shoppers to scan products found in physical stores. The user will then be provided with information about things such as emissions from manufacturing and transport, if a better price is found nearby and also suggestions about related items. In this way the customers will have the ability to on their own make the decision about whether they want to purchase solely based on price or in regards to co2 emissions, if they should buy in store or if they should buy the item online. All this results in a more climate aware thinking and decision making, and a happier customer.
Extending the scope, this could benefit businesses too. Promoting items of nearby stores can stimulate local growth while also making small businesses more visible to customers.

> With this concept, we envision a possible ecosystem where businesses join the “app” and therefore agrees to being transparent with their emissions data. This would then encourage other stores to join since being a part of this “community” acts as great marketing for companies.”
During the project, we first did parallel prototyping. Based on the individual prototypes we then went on to pick the best aspects of each to create what in the end became the final version. 

Some of the things I did and what I learned

* Created the logotype and the foundation for the visual identity
* put together the final clickable prototype (spending 2 hours linking frames)
* Being slightly better at “kill your darlings”
