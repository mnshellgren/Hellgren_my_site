Worked for two summers as a front end developer for Impactpool, a career platform within International development.
The first summer, I assisted in implementing the first version of a new b2b-dashboard. The work consisted mostly of front end development with React, but also I also assisted in doing some UX research for the initial steps of renewing the onboarding process on the platform. 

This year, I was the lead of a project which involved redesigning a part of the website that serves career resources, which involved UX research, user testing, creating lots of mockups as well as planning together with the team to set a long term direction for career resources as well as some short term actions, most of which I finished implementing before the end of the summer. This summer I also worked on reviewing Impactpoolâ€™s design system together with two other designers from the team. My focus was to make sure that the design system includes documentation about the career resources section, which consists of several visual variations of components.

What I take with me from these two summers:

* Working in a team on a real product
* Increased front end development knowledge, mostly in Javascript and React.js
* Basic knowledge of back-end structure and how  to work with an API
* Experience in leading a smaller design project
* User testing
* Basic knowledge of Elasticsearch
