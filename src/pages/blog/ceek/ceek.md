This was a small web project I did in October 2018. My father owns a company – Ceek, which is a small consultancy firm specializing in delivering solutions within marketing communications. 

I built the website using Gatsby.js, a static site generator that Is my go-to solution for creating websites that are not only easily managed but also performs really well in terms of performance. 

When it came to the layout, I knew that since Ceek has not existed as a consultancy firm for very long, I would not need more than a one page site with contact information to my father together with a description of what Ceek offers. In addition to building the website, I also created the beginning visual identity for Ceek. Most of my ideas came from having designed the Logotype for Ceek, which in terms of color used a combination of black and a pinkish red color. Using that as the base for the design for the website, I found that white worked the best together with those two colors. With the pinkish red color being the accent, I then went on with giving the contact information icons in the same color. Fonts used are Karla for body text and Rubik for headings and other non-body elements.

Summary of the things I did and learned during this project:

* Configuring Gatsby image – a plugin for handling lazy loading, adaptive image sizes etc
* Logo design
